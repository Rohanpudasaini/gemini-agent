# Gemini AI Agent - Learning Project

A Python-based AI coding agent built using Google's Gemini API, following Boot.dev's comprehensive AI Agent course.

## 📚 About This Project

This repository contains my implementation of an AI Agent built while following the **"Build an AI Agent"** course from [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev). The course teaches how to create an intelligent coding agent that can understand, reason, and execute tasks using Google's Gemini AI model.

### Course Information

- **Course Name**: Build an AI Agent
- **Platform**: [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev)
- **Video Tutorial**: [Guide to Agentic AI – Build a Python Coding Agent with Gemini](https://youtube.com) (YouTube)
- **Primary Technology**: Google Gemini API
- **Language**: Python

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through this course, I'm learning to:

- Understand the fundamentals of agentic AI systems
- Build an AI agent that can autonomously perform tasks
- Integrate Google's Gemini API for natural language processing
- Implement tool-calling and function execution patterns
- Design agent architectures for real-world applications
- Handle context management and conversation flow
- Create a coding agent capable of understanding and generating code

## 🚀 What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is an autonomous system that can:
- Perceive its environment through inputs
- Make decisions based on its programming and AI models
- Take actions to achieve specific goals
- Learn and adapt from interactions

This project specifically focuses on building a **coding agent** that can assist with programming tasks using the power of Google's Gemini AI.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before getting started, you should have:

- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- A Google Cloud account with Gemini API access
- Familiarity with APIs and environment variables
- Git for version control

## 📦 Installation

*(Instructions will be updated as the project progresses)*

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohanpudasaini/gemini-agent.git
   cd gemini-agent
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your API keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your Gemini API key
   ```

## 🏗️ Project Structure

*(Will be updated as code is added)*

```

## 💻 Usage

*(Usage instructions will be added as the project develops)*

```python
# Example usage (to be implemented)
from agent import GeminiAgent

agent = GeminiAgent()
response = agent.execute("Your task here")
print(response)
```

## 🧪 Testing

*(Testing instructions will be added as the project progresses)*
